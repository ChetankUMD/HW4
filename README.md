# MSML606 HW4: Quicksort & Heapsort

## 📌 Objective
Implement **Randomized Quicksort** and **Heapsort** (no built-in sort/heap packages). Analyze performance on various inputs.

## 📁 Files
- `Homework4.py` – Sorting implementations  
- `testcases.csv` – Sample inputs  
- `README.md` – This file

## ✅ Tasks
- Implement both algorithms from scratch  
- Test on random, repeated, ordered, and reverse inputs  
- Measure runtime (`time.perf_counter()`) and memory (`tracemalloc`)  
- Handle exceptions (e.g., `RecursionError`)  
- Document findings in the report

## 🧪 Grading (40 pts)
- Quicksort (10)
- Heapsort (10)
- Performance analysis (5)
- Report: description, complexity, comparison, trends (15)

## ▶️ Run
```bash
python Homework4.py
```
